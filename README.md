# OPT
Do you want to program usin the worst language ever existed? Use PHP, this one holds the 2nd place.

## Rules
### Variables
Comming from C# Where YouLikeToCallEachAndEveryVariableWithTenPlusWords? Well forget about it! Here you have only 6 characters available! No more indexOfTheCharacterInTheString, only i, j, k, l... 

Love snake_case? This language is jUST fOR yOU! oH wAIT wHAT? That's right! There is only one proper naming of the variables! The first character is lowercase, the other ones are UPPERCASE! iSN'T iT gREAT??? yEAHHH (don't forget that you can use only 6 characters for one variable)

### Keywords
As a team of developers of the most progressive programming language in the world we decided that it would be fun to make all our keywords capitalized! Like in BASIC, the second most progressive language in the world!

### OOP
You like OOP? Oh well, we too! But that's kind of different type of OOP here... The first letter stands for "Oh", the last couple is "Oleksandr" and "Porubaimikh" (IN THE NAME OF THE CREATOR, HOORRAY!). Yeahh... 
Sorry for that, but hey, that's even better! Why creating new data types for evey single (f)art when you can just have int16_t (short int) as your main and only data type at all! No more confusion, plain performance of development

### Money
Love money? Who doesn't! 

### Comments
Back to money. Documentation of projects (yes, it's full-featured, production-ready thingie actually) written in this language turns out to be pretty expensive! You may ask why, and I actually insist you do, because otherwise we're not moving forward.

> But... Why????????

Thank's for asking. I will answer you in a minute.

### Operators
We like to state that a good-written code is the one which can be read as an open book, causing euphoria and other manifistations of an absolute pleasure. That's why we decided to use the best representations of well-known operators. 

BEHOLD!!!

Less and greater: `!<` and `>!`, assignment: `<-`, as promised, comments: `$$` (that's why it's expensive! Get it? I mean, dollars, LOL), addition: `++`, subtraction: `--`, multiplication: `**`.

---
Well, at least you don't need to put a `$` at the beginning of every variable...
